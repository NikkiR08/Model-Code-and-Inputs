# Model-Code-and-Inputs
The .R files and .csv input files for the general version and Viet Nam case study, for a One Health model of agricultural AMR interventions
The R file for the Viet Nam case study and general version of the model, and the input spreadsheets for both
'code - general model.R' is the R file for the version of the model which is not parameterised to a particular country or location. It uses the input file 'inputs - general model.csv' 
'code - case study.R' is the R file for the case study version of the model, simulating a specific intervention in present-day Viet Nam. It uses the input fiile 'inputs - case study.csv'. It additionally uses two input files 'Vietnam Population.csv' and 'Viet Nam dependency ratio.csv' 
To run either model, download the relevant .R file and .csv file(s). Ensure that both .R files and all four .csv files are in the same folder and that the packages used in both models are already installed. The models can be run straight away 
A major aim of these models is that they be used to simulate One Health AMR interventions in agriculture in other real-life contexts. In order to do this, researchers and policymakers can alter the inputs to reflect the context of interest. Because it may be difficult to determine all of the necessary parameters for the context of interest, we recommend the following: 1) choose the income category scenario that is most appropriate (low-income (LIC), middle income centred on smallholder agricultre (MIC-s), middle income centred on industrial agriculture (MIC-i) or high income); 2) in the input file for the general version of the model, 'iinputs.csv', edit the parameters in the column of the chosen income category where they are known, and leave the remaining parameters unchanged; 3) open the general version of the model 'General Model.R' and select the relevant income category by editing the line 'scenario_income <- "..... '; 4) run the model and obtain results! the more accurately the user is able to parameterise the model to the context of the interest, the more accurate the results
